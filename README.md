### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my portfolio, I built this during my 8-week Introduction to Web Development course. This was created to host the current projects I'm working on see it live on my github pages

- I used inline styling and bootstrap to customize my navigation bar and main sections.
- rgba CSS to make the main sections of my portfolio semi-transparent.

Currently I'm working on adding additional functionality to my website, specifically adding more JavaScript to my contact form.
