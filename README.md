### Hi there 👋

Welcome to my portfolio, I built this during my 8-week Introduction to Web Development course. This was created to host the current projects I'm working on.

- I used inline styling and bootstrap to customize my navigation bar.
- rgba CSS to make the main sections of my portfolio semi-transparent.

Currently I'm working on adding additional functionality to my website, specifically adding more JavaScript to my form.
